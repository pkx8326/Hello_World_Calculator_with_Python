# Hello_World_Calculator_with_Python
This is a very simple calculator program with Python. It's a "Hello World" of a calculator. It demonstrates the use of functions that takes inputs and returns values.

The program lets the user enter a first number, then choose an operator, then enter a second number. The program then displays a result based on the two numbers and the operator chosen by the user.

✔️ The first version is a very simple calculator. The user inputs the two operands and chooses an operator. The user will be ask if he/she wants to perform another calculation. The user cannot carry over any calculation result to the next calculations.

✔️ The second version of the program is a bit more complicated. After each calculation, the user will have an option to perform the next calculations with the result of the current calculation, or to start everythin over from 0. The user can also choose to quit the program after each calculation.
